How do I compile this thing
==================
You need a x86_64-elf toolchain in your PATH.
and you should have qemu in your path.
and GNU make.

You should compile this on Windows 10+ as it has
a curl binary bundled with it.

To make a initrd and run the OS. Run `make run`

There are no cdrom images available yet.
